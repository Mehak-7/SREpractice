# Monitoring and Alerting System for a server

This code is a simple system monitoring script that collects CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics for a server and sends email alerts if any of the metrics exceed their thresholds. The script can be customized to collect different metrics and send alerts to different recipients.

The script uses the ***psutil*** library to collect system metrics. The ***psutil*** library provides a number of functions for collecting system information, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. The script uses the ***send_alerts()*** method to send email alerts. The ***send_alerts()*** method takes three arguments: the metric that exceeded the threshold, the threshold value, and the recipient of the email alert. The script collects system metrics periodically. The frequency of the collection can be customized by changing the interval variable. The default value for interval is 10 seconds. The script sends email alerts with an appropriate subject. The subject of the email alert is generated by the ***get_subject()*** function. The ***get_subject()*** function takes two arguments: the metric that exceeded the threshold and the threshold value. The script uses ***Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)*** to send email alerts. SMTP is a standard protocol for sending email messages. The script uses the smtplib library to send email messages.

The script can be customized to collect different metrics and send alerts to different recipients. To customize the script, you can change the following variables:

**metrics**: This variable is a list of the metrics that the script will collect.

**thresholds**: This variable is a dictionary that maps metrics to thresholds. The thresholds are the values that the metrics must exceed in order to trigger an email alert.

**recipients**: This variable is a list of email addresses that will receive the email alerts.


## To use this script:

1. Install psutil library using "***pip install psutil***"
2. Install smtplib library using "***pip install smtplib***"
3. Set up your config.ini file to contain [SMTP] information for host, port, username and password (The code is already set up to read information from this file)
3. Run the python script with correct email address to send and recieve using "***python main.py***"

*In this example, there is an alert sent when the memory threshold is crossed, i.e. goes above 50. An email is sent to the specified email address through the sender email address(also specified) with the correct subject and other information as provided. For this case, the timeout was set to 10 seconds.*
